Testing Socket PDU Repacker

Two flowgrahps and accompanying Python files are included. 

Input (Python to GRC):
  Open socket_pdu_repacker_input.grc and run. 
  Open send_socket_python.py and run.

  This will write a vector of floats to socket 52001 and a vector of bytes to 52002
  The Socket PDU Repacker will handle the conversion to floats and change the PDU length accordingly



Output (GRC to Python):
  Open read_socket_python.py and run. 
  Open socket_pdu_repacker_output.grc and run.

  This will use Vector PDU sources to write floats to socket 52001 and bytes to 52002.
  The Socket PDU repacker at the output will convert the floats to their 4-byte representation for UDP
  The Python script will use the struct library to unpack the received UDP messages into vectors. 
  There will be one vector for floats and one vector for bytes.
