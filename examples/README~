Testing Socket PDU Repacker

Open socket_pdu_repacker.grc and run. 
Open send_floats_python.py and run.

The output of the Socket should be a PDU vector of bytes (4 bytes per float).
To reinterpret the vector as floats, we read the vector (dividing the length by 4 to get the number of floats). 
This new vector is passed along. The data is now a vector of floats and the vector length is correct.

The corrected vector can be seen at the final PDU Debug. For comparison, a PDU Debug is connected directly to the
output of the Socket to PDU.
